# Interactive Neural Networks
This project aims to provide an interactive and visual approach to understanding Neural Networks (NNs) and their components. From personal experience, 
universities, online courses and books cover the basics of NNs mathematically and functionally but are unsuccessful at providing an interactive approach to 
understanding them. One exception is Tensorflow’s [playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/). However, this lacks depth in how NNs operate at a 
foundational level.

Furthermore, [Sebastian Lague’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c) video on creating NNs inspired this project and is the basis for its content.
